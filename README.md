Database description

The database comprises an integrated set of proximal geophysical measurements, field morphological observations,
and laboratory physical and chemical analyses obtained from nine Aridisol profiles in a representative sector of the Atacama Desert.
Proximal sensing data were collected in situ and in a depth-resolved manner using gamma-ray spectrometry, magnetic susceptibility (κ),
and soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) sensors, providing continuous vertical information on radionuclide contents, ferrimagnetic mineral distribution,
and soil salinity–moisture conditions.

To support and validate the pedogeophysical interpretation, the database incorporates laboratory-derived physical and chemical soil properties,
including particle-size distribution, bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity of soil extracts, exchangeable cations, and selected elemental and mineralogical indicators.
These analytical data were used to characterize diagnostic horizons, constrain interpretations of ECa and κ signals, and establish relationships between geophysical variables and soil attributes.

Detailed morphological descriptions of soil horizons were used to align field and laboratory datasets and to ensure consistency in the vertical organization of the database.
All variables were harmonized at the profile scale to represent the influence of lithology, climate, and geomorphology on soil development. The compiled dataset was analyzed using the R software
environment through descriptive statistics, mean comparison tests, multivariate analyses, and Spearman correlation to explore pedogeophysical–pedological relationships across Aridisol profiles.
